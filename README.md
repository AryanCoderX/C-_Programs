# DSA in C++ – Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all the C++ programs I’ve written as part of my journey to learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through the **Apna College** course on YouTube.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a work-in-progress. I am still actively learning and adding new content as I progress through the course.

## 📘 About

This repository serves as a personal archive of my DSA practice using C++. The programs here are based on concepts taught in the Apna College course and include both theory-based examples and practical problem-solving code.

## 🧠 Topics Covered (So Far)

- Basics of C++
- Time and Space Complexity
- Arrays and Strings
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion
- Pointers
- 2D Arrays
- Bit Manipulation
- Functions and STL (as covered)

> More advanced topics like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more will be added as I learn them.
